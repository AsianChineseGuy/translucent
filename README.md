  23 Virtual desktop speed swapping is great for single monitor with multiple windows open.
  24 The script is not mine and I couldn't find the original. Credits to whoever wrote this because it's crazy good for multi tasking.
  25 Usage:
  26 alt + 1, alt + 2, alt + 3
  27
  28 The script is a little buggy when it comes to handling windows applications eg;
  29 Attempting to swap from desktop 1 to 3 where desktop 2 has explorer.exe open causes the swapping to stop at desktop 2. Vice versa
  30 For some reason it seem to shift the current focus window to explorer.exe
  31 Best use it with only 2 virtual desktop
  32
  33 Change focused window transparency, another script where I couldn't find the original. Credits to whoever made this.
  34 Usage:
  35 winkey + scrollwhell up/down
  36 winkey + o to reset
  37 winkey + g to show current settings
